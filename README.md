## xmas.hs

Here's my solution to an exercise on Learn You A Haskell Chapter 9: Input and Output

The original problem set by [Functional Brighton](https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Brighton/) group:

Draw an ASCII xmas tree.
E.g., combine triangle(s) and rectangle.
The program should accept the height of the tree as input.

E.g.,

```
How tall a tree? 3

  ***
 *****
   |
```
